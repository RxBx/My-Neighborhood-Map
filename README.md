#My Neigborhood Map - Project 5 - Udacity FEND

##Introduction

This app allows users to search and filter a list of nearly 100 architecturally significant places in Los Angeles, examine them on a map, and view specific information about them in an "info window."

It uses various Google Maps and Wikipedia API capabilities, as well as responsive design via CSS, and KnockoutJS to handle dynamic changes in the "View."

##Loading and Examining the project

- You can view and analyze a live version of the project thru GitHub Pages:
http://rxbx.github.io/My-Neighborhood-Map/

- You can examine the original files at the following link:
https://github.com/RxBx/My-Neighborhood-Map

You can launch the app locally from the file in the directory by opening "index.html" in a web browser.

##Code Notes

- Live code uses minified JS & CSS
- CSS uses BEM methods to create class hierarchies, and avoid use of "ID" rules
- App starts via callback function after successful Google Map API load
- KnockoutJS triggers are used for CSS style changes, as well as onscreen data manipulation

##Sources

Code is my own, but I made use of all of the expected code references, including:

- Mozilla Developer Network
- StackOverflow
- KnockoutJS Documentation
- CSS Tricks
- Google Maps Javascript API documentation
- Wikipedia/WikiMedia API documentation

...as well as many other "drive by" Google search hits!
