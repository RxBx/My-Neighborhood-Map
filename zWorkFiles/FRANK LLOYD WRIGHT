FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT

Hollyhock House

An artists' complex designed for heiress Aline Barnsdall, recognized by the American Institute of Architects as one of the seventeen Wright buildings that are representative of his contribution to American culture. The main house is open for tours, but three buildings still stand on the site:

Hollyhock House
Hollyhock House Garage and Chauffeur's Quarters
Hollyhock House Residence A

Anderton Court Shops

These shops are a little-known Wright design that is not generally recognized as one of his better works and it has been extensively reworked from its original look, but it's easy to access. See it here.

More Frank Lloyd Wright Sites in the Los Angeles Area

Everything else Wright in Los Angeles is not open for public visits.

However, most of these structures can be seen from a respectful distance on the street or sidewalk.

Ennis House: This large and lovely home is on the National Register of Historic Places, a Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Monument, and a California State Landmark. After some devastating damage and a long search for the right buyer, the house is under renovation. Ennis House history, location, photos
Freeman House: One of three textile block houses Wright designed in the Hollywood Hills in the 1920s, this one was built for two members of the Los Angeles avant-garde. The Freeman House suffered earthquake damage and is not currently available for tours.
