Gehry House

Starting with a Dutch Colonial Revival and building around it, Gehry would strip much of the interior while adding a new exterior of wood clad in plywood, glass, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing.

Architect Frank Gehry's first major public work celebrates California's history in the aviation and aerospace industries with an ingenious use of space and light, an allusion to the challenges of aerospace design.

While many of Gehry's designs appear to be as much sculptures as structures, The Gemini G.E.L. (Graphics Editions Limited) building fits squarely into the latter category.

A testament to Frank Gehry's passion for utilitarian material, The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is dominated by chain link used to create a set of three-dimensional objects extending vertically and obliquely from the center of the complex.

Little known at the time and having never designed a campus, Frank Gehry drew on classical settings like the Roman Forum to visually evoke the history and weight of the legal profession.

The Deconstructivist triplex design features separate, loft-like, two-story units which the architects dubbed "the three little pigs," one in stucco, one in plywood, and one covered head to toe in green asphalt roof shingles.

A deconstructed version of a building looking at first more like a drawing of a building than the thing itself, Gehry's design fragments the building into separate parts that play with light, shadow, and reflection.

ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST

Davis Studio and Residence – Malibu, California
Frank Gehry completed this Malibu live/work residence for artist Ron Davis in 1968, six years after he launched his architecture practice in Los Angeles. While the Davis commission was not Gehry’s first project, it did presage his signature design vocabulary, thanks to a slanted roof that makes the trapezoidal house appear to torque. Today the place is home to actor Patrick Dempsey and his family. (See AD’s March 2014 cover story, "California Dreamy," featuring the Dempseys’ house.)

Gehry House – Santa Monica, California
Gehry’s first significant brush with fame came with the 1978 construction of a Santa Monica residence he designed for himself and his family. The project wrapped an existing bungalow in angular volumes clad in a riot of everyday suburban materials like plywood and chain link. As opinionated as it was sculptural, the house earned both cheers and jeers in short order. In 2012 it won the American Institute of Architects’ prestigious Twenty-Five Year Award.

Loyola Law School – Los Angeles
The 1978 commission to expand Loyola Law School would propel Gehry into institutional work. He reimagined Loyola’s downtown Los Angeles site as a neotraditional campus, arranging a stylistically diverse set of buildings and surrounding them with a knoll-like landscape. During initial design work, a strategy was developed to allow the expansion of the campus in several phases, cor­responding to the priorities of the school. The last phase of the design was completed in 2003.

Chiat/Day complex – Venice, California
The 1991 Venice, California, complex that Gehry built for advertising agency Chiat/Day commonly goes by the nickname Binoculars Building, thanks to the enormous pair of binoculars that mark the entrance to a parking garage—a collaboration between Gehry and artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. Office structures resembling a ship’s prow and tree trunks flank the sculpture, which now welcomes 500 Google employees to work every day.

Walt Disney Concert Hall – Los Angeles
Gehry was shortlisted to devise a new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1988; the project, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, finally opened in 2003. Today critics and the public agree that the iconic building was worth the wait. Reflecting Gehry’s longtime passion for sailing, the structure’s exterior features expanses of stainless steel that billow above Grand Avenue, while inside, similarly shaped panels of Douglas fir line the auditorium.
